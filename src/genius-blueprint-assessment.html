                        <p><strong>About the Genius Blueprint Profiles</strong></p>

                        <p>There are a total of eight Genius Blueprint profiles and each one plays an equally important role in a team. In any business, there is a natural progression to follow to successfully complete a project, similar to the natural growth cycles that occurs in nature.</p>
                        <img data-src="img/1.png" alt="">
                        <p>In nature, the cycle of creation starts in spring with a seed that shoots up through the soil. In summer, this seed will grow into a plant with the support of people who care for it. In autumn, the plant produces fruit that will be collected and distributed. When winter arrives, the plant will hibernate and slow down in preparation for spring.</p>

                        <p>The Genius Blueprint categorizes the different profiles by seasons, because business follows a similar growth cycle. Spring represents the ideation phase, because this is when people ask themselves what it is that they want to create. This is also the time when the vision for an idea takes shape and becomes a prototype. Summer represents the expansion and amplification phase. This is where the majority of growth happens. During this phase, people will take the prototype and develop it into something can be replicated and applied. The implementation phase occurs in the Fall. This is when planning and organization takes place and the product or service is tested to ensure that it delivers what was intended. Winter is the the analysis and reproduction phase. During this time, people will review what is working and will simplify and automate the process.</p>

                        <p><strong>HOW THE GENIUS BLUEPRINT ASSESSMENT ALSO BENEFITS THE ORGANIZATION</strong></p>

                        <p>It is also possible to activate superpowers and upgrade mindset on an organizational level. Research has found that the conditions for creating a high performing team include psychological safety, dependability, structure and clarity, meaning, and impact.</p>

                        <p>The Genius Blueprint helps create these conditions within an organization, by changing the organization’s mindset, or level of consciousness.</p>
                        <img data-src="img/2.png" alt="">
                        <p>Organizations can be viewed as superhuman living systems similar to biological systems, where a single cell represents the individual, a group of cells represents a team, and the biological system represents the organization. Each group of cells will have a different function similar to how organs have different functions in the body. The organs work together to help the body run optimally. What makes the organization superhuman and different from a biological system is that it has its own way of thinking, values, and beliefs. This creates the organization’s culture and drives its behaviours.</p>

                        <p>An organization’s mindset or level of consciousness determines how they see their people, who they hire, how they work, and what kind of product they create. It also influences how they see their customers, partners, and employees. Every organization has a Genius potential waiting to be activated and realized. As an organization upgrades its mindset and accesses its Genius, its adaptability and potential for unique and innovative products increases.</p>

                        <p><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></p>

                        <p>Q. What makes this personality assessment different from other ones on the market and how would I benefit from taking it?</p>

                        <p>A. The Genius Blueprint assessment is a practical and heart centered way to prepare yourself for the future. Through the unique approach laid out in The Genius Activator Workbook, you will identify your natural talents and what puts you in your flow, which you can use to redefine the way you experience work. Rather than executing routine tasks, you will be able to address unseen problems and opportunities by cultivating and using your human capabilities.</p>

                        <p>Q. There is a lot of information and assessments available for free. What is the benefit in purchasing this one?</p>

                        <p>A. It is true that there are many free resources available online and many of them are valuable. However, this one of the only assessments that leverages your natural strengths and what puts you in your flow to upgrade your mindset and how you operate in the world.</p>
                        <p>There are numerous benefits to understanding your natural talents and flow. However, the true transformation comes from being able to apply this information to your life.</p>

                        <p>The Genius Activator Workbook is a way to experience some of the benefits of exclusive coaching at a more accessible cost and was developed from over two decades of experience recruiting, coaching, and managing top talent at start-ups and larger companies in Silicon Valley. It provides step by step guidance, so you can take what you learn from the assessment and translate it into action to improve your self-confidence, increase your productivity and enjoyment at work, and expand your professional opportunities.</p>

                        <p>Q. Is there any science to support that upgrading your mindset can increase productivity, flow, and satisfaction in the work environment?</p>

                        <p>Multiple universities and organizations have conducted extensive research on mindset. Many of the findings have suggested that people who are focused on growth, problem solving, and self improvement are more likely to be successful.</p>

                        <p>For instance, a paper presented at the European Coaching Psychology Conference found the most important factor for increasing productivity and creativity within an organization was realizing the full potential of the employees, regardless of the industry. The most effective way to do this was to create a company culture that promotes self-awareness and emotional well-being. (1)</p>
                        <p>Additionally, a meta-analysis conducted by the University of Birmingham School of Psychology found that when teams are put together based on the personality traits of the individuals, there was a significant increase in the level of trust, cooperation, and ability to achieve goals. (2)</p>

                        <p><strong>The Genius Blueprint Assessment</strong> identifies the individual characteristics that put you in your natural flow. It also increases self-awareness around your current thinking and how you relate to others. <strong>The Genius Activator Workbook</strong> offers a way to upgrade your mindset to increase your sense of well-being and ability to contribute to your team.</p>
